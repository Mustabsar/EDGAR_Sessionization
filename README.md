# EDGAR Sessionization

The Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) system by the SEC maintains (publicly available) weblogs that is a collection of entries corresponding to document access from different IP addresses at different timestamps. This project is about [sessionizing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Session_(web_analytics)) that data to get a summary of individual session durations, idle period, and number of documents requested per session.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system

To get a copy of the project up and running, simply copy the following code to your command line while you are working in the project directory

```
$ ./run.sh
```


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
